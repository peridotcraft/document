                    <p>
                        PERIDOTはあらゆる人が手軽にFPGAを利用できるよう設計されています。PERIDOT is designed to create a world where anybody can use the FPGA easily.
                    </p><p>Using the Physicaloid library makes the FPGA development easier to use, in a way a someone would combine parts of a component.</p>
